### Philosophy
The goal of this challenge is to obtain insight on how you approach everyday tasks. Complete the challenge by writing code that you would reuse again, maybe even 2-3 years from now. Keep it simple.

### Values
- We've largely transitioned to Kotlin but still have a good bit of our codebase in Java.
- Clean code, reusability, structure, and hierarchy is highly valued.
- Code formatting, reviews and tests are the norm.
- We avoid the over reliance on 3rd party libraries, _however_ there are times when it makes sense to not re-invent the wheel.
- Branch early and often. Commit messages are meant to be brief and informative.
- We realize StackOverflow, Google, etc exists; inspiration is all good, just attribute it in your code.

### Time Limit
We think it should take about 2-3 days to complete the challenge.  It is OK to leave reasonable TODOs in the code if you run out of time or see an area you'd like more time, just explain yourself.

### The Challenge
1. Create a simple app with a text entry field, and as you type it will display autocomplete results from the Apple iTunes Store Search API endpoint.
2. Once the user selects one of the results, transition to a new view showing basic information pulled from the iTunes API. The way you display the results, detailed view, and depth is up to you.

When you're all done:

- Commit your project to the repo
- If there are any special instructions to get your project running, please let us know
- Ping us when you're finished and we'll clone the repo and run it in our environment

### Review
We'll be looking at the following (not necessarily in this order):

- Code Quality
	- Is the code reasonably easy to understand and well-organized?
	- Does your app run out of the box?
	- Is your code reasonably robust (error handling, no internet connection, etc)?

- Functionality
	- Core functionality, bells and whistles are just that
	- Accuracy of the returned results

- Experience
	- How does the user experience feel?
	- Will my mom understand what to do in the app?
